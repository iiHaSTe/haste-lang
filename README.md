# Haste Lang :D 
Is a semicolon based language (I don't want to suffering while im make this language so eat grass) and generale purpose language. fast (Not yet because Im currently making it in my mobile device so i have to translate it to JavasScript to run the code which is cool feature) and i run out of creativity so wait a 3000 year while im thinking about new features XD.

[Note:
**_All language features and subject are temporary 
and able to change_**]

## Features:
- How to try it? <br/>
Just install the repo in your device and make a folder inside the project called `dist`
which has the JavaScript output.

- They are some native **data types** like: <br/>
> **String**: `"I'm a string :D"` <br/>
> **Integer**: `69` (y'all need some one to wash your mind 💀) <br/>
> **Float**: `69.69` (🤨) <br/>
> **boolean**: `false false true true false true true false  false false true true true false false true`

- And some built-in methods: <br/>
> **print**: `print "I love penguin 🐧";`<br/>
> **exit**: `exit 0;`<br/>
[Note: **I'll make it possible to apply an parentheses to methods as optional way (just if they're one argument applied to the function)**]

- Variable declaration: <br/>
```haste
var msg = "Hey!!!";
var msg_2 = "\"Hello :0\"";
var h = 32;
```

- Comments (Cuz why not!):
```haste 
# Comment :D (I don't like the hash mark style I'll change it latter on)
```

- Code sample:
```haste
print "Don't wait for me to write 'Hello world' here!";
print 69;
print 69.69;
print true;
print false;
exit 0; # ends the program :D
```

- Very Very Very BIG Secret...
<p style="font-size: 2pt;">I will add a main method<br/>Don't worry i wouldn't make java's misstake</p>
